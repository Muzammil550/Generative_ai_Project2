"Depression Tweet Classification using Neural Network & Random Forest"

##Overview
This project aims to classify tweets as depressed or not depressed using Sentence Transformers (MiniLM) for text embeddings and two classification models:

A Neural Network (PyTorch)
A Random Forest Classifier (Sklearn)
üõ† Features
Preprocesses tweet text using NLTK (stopword removal, lemmatization)
Converts text to embeddings using Sentence-BERT (MiniLM)
Implements a PyTorch-based Neural Network classifier
Implements a Random Forest classifier for comparison
Saves the best-performing Neural Network model


Pandas & NumPy
 To-Do
 Implement more advanced deep learning models (e.g., LSTMs, GRUs)
 Experiment with different text embedding models
 Fine-tune hyperparameters for better accuracy
